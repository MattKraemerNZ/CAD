This is a compilation of the work I feel comfortable sharing with the world.

I love open source. I use it all the time and I contribute bug fixes to various projects. However, my robotics lab and my family are sustained by money and I haven't yet figured out how to make money on open source projects.

Here in this repository you should find a lot of my solidworks projects from years past.

You will not find:

  -My clever python code
  -My clever computer vision code
  -Anything particularly clever for that matter
  -My carbon fibre technology
  -My safedriver project
  -My dry-chamber design
  -Any work that is not my own to share
